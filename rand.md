> Muito obrigado meu Deus, por tudo dia. Eu aprender tudo dia, e eu e mais grande tudo segundo.
> I am so thankful for everything that I am learning while on this crazy trip called life. The type and amount of different experiences
> available to encounter and experience is infinite. It makes me so humble. Before I left Brazil now, I was emotionally roller-coasting
> through some new and old feelings. A very interesting thing actually, because I thought I was so increadibly much stronger now.
> It seems everything happens while you least expect it to. If it weren't like that, it would be kind of boring to live too.
>
> I have learned that whenever I want things to be different, is when I need to suck in what's there for me in that very moment.
> Whenever I think I need more than I have; I am wrong. Whenever I think I am better than someone else; I am wrong. Because
> I don't have to be. All I have to be is myself. All I have to do is to stand up for my opinions. All I need to say is positive things.
>
> I look forward to returning to Gordo's jiu-jitsu academy. They raised me. They brought me up from being a pushover, to being something.
> Something unique. Something with integrity. Something loving. And to be someone that has the ability to achieve anything I put
> my mind to. Usually, the only thing stopping me is to actually put my mind to it. I have been lazy for so long. I have been spoiled
> for so many years. Or; not really spoiled, but brought up in circumstances where I haven't been forced to work for what I want.
> I have been drifting on a cloud of comfort. And even then; expecting things to be better than they were yesterday. They will never be.
> Without effort, work, mindfulness and crazy dreams, things will never change.
>
> I am determined to change the world to the better. In new and creative ways. In ways I don't even know yet.
>
> I will be the most comfortable motherfucker in the whole world. And with that, I will be the world champion of Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
> My blue belt will taste so much more sweat and blood. It will feel cold, warm, wet, dry.
> Oh how I want to train with the guys again. It will be goooood. Finding my momentum again. Finding my style. My drift. Catch it?
>
> I will try look at the world with these new eyes. With the view I had on things when I was a child. Simply as a mind, trapped in
> some kind of body, in some kind of physical world, with psychic powers and capabilities to communicate with other beings. This
> way of lookin at things may be what I have been looking for all along. It may be what I let go because it got scary when I was younger.
>
> Yesterday when I was sleeping, I saw the same visions of shadowy beings approach me in the dark. Before I was afraid, but now I had
> the courage to stay calm. To stay calm and just exist. Simply observe.
>
> I _will_ find my Buddah nature. The mindset of Zen. Like Kintaró, I will go into the forest and fight the biggest scariest creature there is.
> And, of course, I will win.
