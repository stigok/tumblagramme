Can SÃ¶nmez I've always subscribed to the 'aliveness' concept popularised by Matt Thornton and his SBGi gym: drilling with progressive resistance. It's the foundation of my approach to structuring a class. I.e:

- warm up with jiu jitsu movements (shrimping, bridging, side control escapes, standing up in guard, etc)

- show the technique

- drill without resistance to get the mechanics

- drill with increasing resistance to learn the application, troubleshooting with your partner

- specific sparring from the relevant position

- free sparring rounds, starting from that same position and continuing on until submission or time runs out

- review the technique

- stretch
