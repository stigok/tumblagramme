### Thoughts

  - This app is a unified blogging tool for Tumblr
    - Reblog pictures and video from Instagram
      - Automatically like or comment on the original post
    - Take pictures directly, apply filters and upload in simple steps
    - Upload existing shit on your phone
  - Keep queue internal instead of using Tumblr`s, for increased control
  - Predefined tags and post bodies for all posts
  - Turn views into very specific micro modules ish
  - Repost your old top posts automatically & manually
